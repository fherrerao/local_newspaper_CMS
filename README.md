## Description
> This project is a modern, responsive Content Management System (CMS) dashboard built for the "Locals Newspaper" technical test. It allows users to view, search, filter, paginate, create, edit, and delete articles using an intuitive interface matching the provided Figma mockups.
<hr>

## Built With
* **Next.js (App Router):** Chosen for its robust architecture, built-in optimizations (like `<Image>` and routing), and seamless transition between Server and Client Components.
* **React:** Utilized for building an interactive, state-driven user interface.
* **TypeScript:** Implemented to ensure type safety, reduce runtime errors, and provide better developer experience and self-documenting code through interfaces (e.g., `Article`).
* **Tailwind CSS:** Selected for rapid UI development. It allowed for pixel-perfect matching with the Figma designs while easily handling responsiveness (`md:`, `sm:` prefixes) without leaving the component files.

## Getting Started

We'll need to prepare your computer to handle Ruby on Rails, which might be a hassle, so take a deep breath and cope with me :)

If you have Rails 7 installed, you can skip to the [Setup](#setup) section
